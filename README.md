# UAV-flight-simulation
this project is an Autonomous UAV Flight Simulation (C++ / Python) – Built a physics-based framework that drives multiple unmanned aerial vehicles toward configurable way-points while enforcing speed-dependent minimum-turn-radius constraints and automatically switching to counter-clockwise loiter patterns once inside a target’s capture radius.
